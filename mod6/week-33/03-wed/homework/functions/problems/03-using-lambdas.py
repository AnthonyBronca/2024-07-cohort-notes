# In Python, lambda functions work as anonymous functions that evaluates to a
# single expression. You could say it's a little more petite than its JavaScript
# counterpart.

# Write a function `string_multi_print` that accepts a string, `str`, and
# returns a lambda that prints `str` `i` times.

# Write your code here.
def string_multi_print(str):
    pass

string_multi_print('hello ')(2)  # Prints "hello hello "
string_multi_print('wahoo ')(3)  # Prints "wahoo wahoo wahoo "
