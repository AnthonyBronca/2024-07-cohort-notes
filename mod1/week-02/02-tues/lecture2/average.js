/*
Write a function called getAverage that will take in an array of numbers and return the average.

The average is defined by adding all the numbers togethers and then dividing the sum by the count of numbers


Ex: [1,2,3]

average: 2
explanation ->  1 + 2+ 3 = 6
6 / 3 -> 2



Try to solve this using:

1. A for loop
2. A while loop
3. A for of loop

let nums = [5,7,1,22,33,77,23,22,100,23];
let nums2 = [3,55,6,14];

console.log(getAverage(nums)); // 31.3
// console.log(getAverage(nums2)); // 19.5
