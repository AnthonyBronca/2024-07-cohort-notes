/*

write a function called removeVowels. It will take in a string of text that may or may not include vowels.
Vowels are defined as "a", "e", "i", "o", "u".

The function should return a string with all the vowels removed.

Example:

input -> "hello"
output -> "hllo"

Example2:

input -> "GOOD bye"
output -> GD by"


Try to solve this in 2 ways. One way will be by working with just a string, The other is by working with an array


*/




removeVowels("hello"); // "hll"
removeVowels("GOOD bye"); // "GD by"
removeVowels("TRY"); // "TRY"



/* DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE */

module.exports = {removeVowels};
