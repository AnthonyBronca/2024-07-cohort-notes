# Friday Week 1

As we are approaching the end of week 1 there a few list items to go over.

1. Reminder that ChatGPT usage is not allowed. You are here to learn and change your career, not to try and cheat. ChatGPT usage to get by these early problems will only hinder you,
especially when you get later on in the program where ChatGPT will not work anymore. The last thing you want to do is make it to mod 4 or 5, realize ChatGPT won't help anymore, be so far in the program that you can't catch up with months of content missed, and the potentially fail out of the program owing thousands of dollars due to prorated tuition.

2. Encourage you to all work with pairs/group to keep each other accountable and on track with the content

3. Understand that feeling like you are struggling and behind is normal in a bootcamp environment. As long as you are putting in the time and work to understand the material and utilize the things we are going over, that is a good sign that you will perform well during the assessment. Do not start closing your own doors. Your competition to get a job are others who are giving it their all today so that they can have a better tomorrow. Are you doing what it takes to compete?

4. Pair Programming has two roles. A driver and a navigator. The driver is in charge of typing while the navigator is in charge of telling the driver what to do. The Navigator may be the one with the plan, but the driver is like the copilot who writes down what they are told and is keeping an eye for potential faults in the plan/code. You should aim to push your code to each other after each problem, or every 15 minutes. Whatever comes first.

5. The problems Sam and I provide during class are meant to stimulating and challenging. Being able to get through 1 or 2 of the problems is a good sign, but even just working through 1 problem and getting close to the answer is enough to facilitate growth. It takes patience, practice, perserverence, and repetition to succeed, and you all only just now started to see some of these problems for the first time.
