/*

Write a function called reverseString. It will take in a string and reverse it. The function should return
"Did not pass in a valid string", if a non-string is passed in or if the passed in string is empty.

HINT: Try using the typeof functionality (you may have to look it up on MDN and play around with it)

*/




/* DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE */

console.log(reverseString("hello")); //olleh
console.log(reverseString("bye")); // bye
console.log(reverseString("racecar")); // racecar


module.exports = {reverseString};
