# Mod 4 and Section 2

## Mod 4 and Project Details
Welcome to mod 4 and also welcome to section 2!

In mod 4 we will be covering:
- Structured Query Language (SQL)
- Express Framework and advanced servers
- Backend stack
- Databases
- Database Object Relational Mappings
- Frameworks to manage SQL with Javascript
- And some system security concepts
- deploying applications


We will be concluding mod 4, and the rest of every mod in section 2 with a project. In mod 4, we will be making a backend application for a site. This will be made up of a DEPLOYED API server that has an associated database to make queries to. This will also serve as the backend portion to your mod 5 project. The mod 4 project will be completed in pairs/small-groups, whereas the mod 5 project will be solo.

Project week Prep

- Project Weeks are intensive sprint periods where you are required to complete specific number of items per day/week in order to reach your SPRINT goals. You will be heavily working with git and github while also working in a SCUM and AGILE environment to replicate your real-world work environment. SPRINTS are an important period during development teams' lifecycles, and it requires a lot of head-down time. You will need to try and accomodate as much time as you can during these project weeks in order to meet your goal. My personal recommendation is to see if you can work with family/work to have a whole day yourself once a week in order to catch up, given the part-time nature of this program. Try to look ahead in your schedules and plan out how that might go. As an example, when I was in the full-time program I had a week to complete the projects. It would often take about 14 hour coding days every day for 7 days to meet the goal. You will have 2-3 weeks to complete projects so you can aim for 3 - 4 hour coding days for 14 days. Sometimes you may only have time to code for 1 - 2 hours depending on admin work required, and thus having days where you can do 5 - 8 hour coding days would be ideal.

Mod 4 project will start around Jan 13, with coding projected to start around Jan 21 - Feb 3rd.


## Windows Users


If you are on a WINDOWS machine, you WILL BE REQUIRED to use WSL and UBUNTU. WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux) allows you to use your window's linux based kernel to execute commands in a linux enviornment. Ubuntu is the actual linux OS will be using, and this is where ALL of your code will need to happen. You will do things like cloning, coding, pushing, running files, making directories, etc. All on the linux side of your machine rather than the windwos side. This is REQUIRED because there are certain commands and programs we will be using during mod 4 and beyond that are UNIX based in nature. Linux and Ubuntu run on UNIX. Windows naturally uses Windows NT Kernel and things like Bash are not used on windows side of things. Under Mod4, week 19 Day 1, there is a required reading on adding UBUNTU and WSL to your system.





## AI Usage

AI is STRICTLY prohibited to be used, especially on assessments and projects. Section 2 is extremely fast paced with a lot of content and the only way to learn it is to write out code (and run in to bugs) yourself in order to try maximize the bugs you see while in the program. AI cripples your learning process, especially if used as a way to crutch yourself through certain topics without fully understanding the material. AI will NOT work for you during projects, nor will it work in the way you think in a real-world work environment. ASK questions often, CODE often, and communication is key!


## My cohort Info

- On test weeks, we take the test in class on Fridays. While you still have the whole weekend to complete and submit the test if you need additional time, you MUST be working on the assessment on Fridays. During these test days, you will have to share your screen so I can jump through rooms and watch you code. I will be a resource for you if you have questions, are getting stuck, or if there is anything we can do to make it a learning moment. I would rather you learn more on a test if needed, than cheat to pass. If you do need to submit the test and do NOT have a passing score, just reach out to me and we can work something out to see what is going on and how we can prepare you to pass. No problems there. But I do check every submission and if there is any suspicion of cheating, you will have to meet with me 1 on 1 to review some of your code, to a code-along with me, and be able to showcase your knowledge. Failure to support your code will lead to an academic deferral, potential dismissmal (if you have already received a warning once), and if you receive a warning you will still have to retake the test again.

- Although it may be hard to find time during mod 4, we will also do some additional lecture contents. Right now I am planning on teaching you guys Postgres/Post bird on TOP of the sqlite we will be learning. I also hope to teach you all Typescript at some point. During mod 5/6 we may learn things like Mobile development, intro to building your own games, or advanced web tools like containerization, websockets, and AWS. If you have anything in mind that you would want to see, and there is good support for it, let me know and we can see if we can fit it into the schedule.


- We will be starting our Accountability Groups during mod 4. This will be a group in the discord where you all (if you join) will be required to complete work in a more hands-on environment. For example, you would be required to complete some homework and provide proof of completing it. Or you can ask questions to others that are also in the group and may have already completed the work. This way you can work with others you know are doing their required work outside of class and make sure that you can build a strong foundation as an individual and as pairs/groups. Accountability groups may join in for additional lectures on days that those are provided, and they will be called on to showcase some of their work from previous lectures. If you wish to join the accountability group and are not already added to it on discord, send me a DM on discord ðŸ˜„
