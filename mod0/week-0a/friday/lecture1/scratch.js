making a peanut and jelly sandwich:

1. grab bread from the pantry
2. add peanutbutter to one slice
3. add jelly to the other slice
4. put them together
5. enjoy

POLYAS

1. UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM

- We need to grab the peanutbutter from the pantry. We need to put it on the counter
- we need to take out 2 slices of bread per sandwich
- we need to find the peanutbutter jar
- we need to find the jelly jar
- we need a knife (maybe 2)
- open the peanut jar and put peanut butter
- open the jelly jar and put jelly
- smear both of these well
- smash sandwiches together
- take a bite
- profit


2.

1. write a function called makePbJ✅
    - Function should take in pb -> string✅
    - function should take in jelly -> string✅
2. the function should return a string that says "peanubutter and jelly sandwich"
3. save the string in a variable called pbj NOTE: use interpolation with pb, and jelly
4. return it

*NOTE* make sure to invoke the function with pbj variables




*/

// function makePbJ(pb, jelly){
//     let pbj = `${pb} and ${jelly} sandwich`;
//     return pbj;
// }

// console.log(makePbJ("Peanut butter", "Jelly"));
