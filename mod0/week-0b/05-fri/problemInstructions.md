# Instructions

To get started, make sure you run `npm install` in the `05-fri` directory. This will install `node_modules`, and allow you to test your functionality.

To run tests you can use:

- `mocha` -> runs all the tests in order
- `mocha -b` -> runs all the tests until the first stop
- `mocha test/<file name>` to run a specific file test spec
