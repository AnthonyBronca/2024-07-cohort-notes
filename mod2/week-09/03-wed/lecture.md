# Timing and Performance Cont.

We learned that we can test the performance of code in a few ways. We previously used the `Date.now()` method, but now we are also going to work with the `console.time` and `console.timend` functionality. We want to use these so we can chart our performance of a code and more easily visualize what the code's performance looks like.
