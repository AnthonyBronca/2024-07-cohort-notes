# Sorting Algorithms

NOTE YOU DO NOT NEED TO MEMORIZE THE CODE FOR THESE


Sorting algorithms are ways that we can move data around to be sorted in some sort of way.
Sorting algorithms aim to try to cut the process of moving data around, be it in-place or out-of place.


## Bubble Sort

Unsorted Array:

```js
const arr = [3, 2, 0 , 4, 1];

// 1. Compare 3 && 2 -> swap
// 2. Compare


```

## Insertion Sort

## Selection Sort

## Recursive Sort

## Merge Sort

## Quick Sort

## Built-In Sort (Tim Sort / Merge Sort / Quick Sort)
